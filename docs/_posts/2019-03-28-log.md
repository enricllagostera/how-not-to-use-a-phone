title: 2019-03-28 A mistake and a story

---

made a pretty big mistake, with coming to work on it at concordia. here the wifi network configuration basically breaks down the OSC-based workflow, because of how local IPs are assigned. so, I'll have to work on it without actually testing with the device. i guess that is ok, as long as I focus on establishing the flow and structure of the game.

### working on the story

I've been hearing good things about **ink** as a tool for creating dialogue and narrative in games. It is quite flexible and exports files for both integration in Unity and as web-based text game. This sounds like a pretty cool workflow for games that are meant to be moddable or easily changeable, so I'll try to use it for creating the dialogue and small narrative structure of *Red dirt*.

Using Ink and the Inky editor worked very well. It really matched my way fo thinking story and choices, and after having created a similar system for Cook Your Way, adapting this one to the flow of the game was easier. Also, it was more direct to adopt a deeper ues of the tool instead of extending it right away (which was a big mistake in terms of productivity for Cook Your Way).

So, I created a basic visual UI for the text, as a way to guide me through the development. Later I'll change this into the more audio-based UI. I also tried to organize the different features into a [GitHub project on the repo](https://github.com/enricllagostera/how-not-to-use-a-phone/projects/1), just to keep track of things more easily.
