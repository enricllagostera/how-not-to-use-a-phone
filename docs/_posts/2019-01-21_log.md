While writing some ideas for a first experiment, I started listing all the tech basis I could use for it.

On the Unity side, I started looking for plugins that would give me access to other sensors, as the Unity API itself is quite limited on that front. I found a [free plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/android-native-dialogs-and-functions-plugin-106497) that seems to give access to almost all sensors, however, it seems the documentation and support websites are Japanese, so I'll have to learn by checking their code and the instructions included with the package.
