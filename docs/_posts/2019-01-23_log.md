### General concept

Two main elements: 

1. An app that controls the screen, proximity sensor and feedback effects. It needs to be an app to avoid the device from "sleeping" and or disabling the screen.
2. A translucent casing, made of some "warm" material


### Materials for the casing

- Gel wax: https://canada.michaels.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-MichaelsCanada-Site/en_CA/Product-Show?pid=10025406

    Seems to be a clear material, that can be colored with pigments while staying translucent, that is easy to handle and affordable. I think it might be a good bet for making the casing: it might be "warm" enough while also letting the light from the screen leak in the bottom.
