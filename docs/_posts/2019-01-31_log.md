title: Shellphone 0.2

I've restarted development on the Shellphone idea, now fueled by a better and easier to use sensor plugin for Unity, as well as a one-script class for handling vibration feedback on Android. I believe all of the technical info I need for the game idea is ready, so it's time to tie things together.

Basically, the shell will create a coral garden if left alone for long enough. If it is interrupted / taken out of the shell for too long, all the coral garden dies, and the player can only see the final, faded, result. How the coral garden will grow and live depends on where it is is left, how much light it sees, how much it is moved, what is its battery status, and other factors. All these get translated into forms of feedback that are immediate (in showing something matters to the shell) and longer term.
