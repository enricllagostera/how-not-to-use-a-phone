title: Events and communication in an idle game
--- 

I'll focus on designing some of the events that will happen during a play session, as well as their effects and conditions. The idea is to look for moments/interactions that bring forward the aliveness of the shell, both in an immediate sense but also on a longer term.

For brainstorming this, I decided to do a small exercise by making a few cards with 1) different inputs and changes in state and 2) different impacts that could show the consequence of an action. From these, I'll then come up with the details of the short-term and long-term feedbacks involved. Here are some examples of these couplings, with inputs on the left and outputs to the right.

I think I'll start by implementing a few of these, the simpler ones first. So, probably the proximity sensor -> leave me alone warning. I'll make the warning be both sound and vibration-based.
