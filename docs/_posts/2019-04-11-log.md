title: 2019-04-11 After playtesting and starting unistroke recognition

---

After yesterday's playtest (more on that soon), I decided to focus back on the gesture recognizer algorithms. As I had mentioned before, I thought of trying a [unistroke algorithm](http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/index.html), as the magnetic input cannot easily be separated into different strokes. Also, it would support a sense of order and sequence in the gestures, which might enable me to differentiate better between them.

So, I looked for an Unity-specific implementation of that code before rolling out my own, and [thankfully I found one](https://github.com/SteBeeGizmo/DollarUnity). Now I'm in the process of adapting that code to my project's structure. (...) I believe I got most of the moving parts working, including the `ScriptableObject` based serialization and persistence of the pattern data. Unfortunately, because I'm working at Concordia today, I won't be able to try out it out on the device itself, because of WiFi and connectivity limitations.

I also made a short video of the game being played, for showing to Rilla. I believe it does work well enough for a prototype, and I believe I'll call it done (as a prototype) as soon as I can test it with the unistroke gesture algorithm. After that, my work for the course will focus on wrapping this project as a repository with the different tools in a more usable shape and with more documentation.
