## Magnets!

Connection to extensions to hardware that does not alter the smartphone device per se. The MagGetz approach of using magnetic components coupled with the smartphone magnetometers sounds pretty interesting. I hadn't learned much about magnetic extensions to smartphones, but they sound like a great technical possibility, which I'll definitely try out. Besides the advantages outlined by the authors of the MagGetx system, I thought of the following:

- The calibration is the key procedure. This means that a system that allows for the recognition / declaration of the widgets can definitely support a whole variety of customizable inputs.
- As the magnetic sensor does not require power or wireless connections, it would be pretty great for embedded controls. It would also be easy to embed in wearable and fabric-based projects.
- As for DIY, magnets are somewhat cheap and easily available or re-used. If I can find ways to calibrate and gesture-recognize them, they can be great tools for quick prototyping and experimental designs.

## Unity and Android sensors, again

- downloaded new version
- found a super recent open source plugin that seems to be exactly what i need
- I will test re-implementing the shellphone example with this plugin before adding the new controls
- I just found out that my phone has no gyroscope! The horror!
- Unity still creates an aggregate gyroscope out of the existing sensors, so I can use the vanilla Input API for that.
- Now I'll test if it works as some kind of interface for the magnetometer too. Ok, it seems that magnetic fields do not affect the Unity gyroscope. 
- So far, it seems I'll need to combine the plugin and the native input system to get the most out of the Android sensors.

## Shellphone 2.0

I will now start work on the second version of the Shellphone prototype. I'll start a new log for that.
