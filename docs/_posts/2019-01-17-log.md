title: Ideas for experiments

## 01 Discrete positions and shaking

Sensing motion into discrete positions, for use as some kind of rhythm game. This would be done comparing the position of "whiskers" sensors that were calibrated earlier. Might work better in Unity.

This could be used for musical experiments and could be compounded with the proximity sensor to create more complex motions. It could also be coupled with a multitouch "hold" to the phone: this would also change motion considerably.

## 02 Tug of war / marble puzzle

Again with a multitouch hold, players would use the accelerometers and gyros to make a pointer slowly move onscreen so that it can reach targets. This might be too close to Bounden. Another thing that could be done with this basic setup is some sort of variations using changes on other sensors such as temperature or proximity.

### A note on tech

While writing some ideas for a first experiment, I started listing all the tech basis I could use for it. This included JS, Java and C# via Unity.

On the Unity side, I started looking for plugins that would give me access to other sensors, as the Unity API itself is quite limited on that front. I found a [free plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/android-native-dialogs-and-functions-plugin-106497) that seems to give access to almost all sensors, however, it seems the documentation and support websites are Japanese, so I'll have to learn by checking their code and the instructions included with the package.
