title: 2019-04-03 Rewriting the story

---

After drafting and writing the shole story, I had some feedback from Carol. She mentioned that the story lacked grounding, that it was too vague. So, I'm adding more specificity to the scenes in the game. Also, I need to make it clearer when the player reaches the last scene that the "digging" is happening.

### Story rewrite

Carol has talked to me and offered the idea of focusing more on specific locations along the player's path, and maybe having one specific action they need to perform for each of the places in order to move forward. Maybe, have new symbols become available too. This sounds like a good plan. I'm thinking of connecting this direction to also having each location transition be more of a one-way gateway too. Finally, a last idea is to have the final scene be about combining a few symbols together to perform the last action. So, to recap, here is a breakdown:

- [x] Entrance
- [x] Stream (lose sandals)
- [x] Rock (dig book)
- [x] Hill (spot house)
- [x] Farm (plant the seed)    
- [x] One action in each location moves the player to the next; other actions give more detail on current place.
- [x] Final scene as performing each action until the last thing is done.
- [x] Unlock one symbol at every location (Optional).
